###Environment tested

All tests are performed in a cluster of 10 nodes of SoftLayer machines.

###Mesos:
version 0.25.0

###Kubernetes:
1.1 branch with additional tuning from Hai: https://github.com/huang195/kubernetes, packed as a docker image (linsun/km) with performance tuning in the release-1.1-k8sm-tuning branch.

For non-Marathon managed Kubernetes, we start Kubernetes (etcd and km 2 containers) with Ansible Docker module, on meson-master node.


###Benchmark:
Baseline scalability test:
The test executes sequentially the steps below - we wait for completion of each step before starting the next one.

1. Start container on swarm with busybox image, default docker networking with docker bridge and icc = true, and the default httpd server

2. Capture the time it takes for docker run to return - 'Container Launched'

3. Use inspect on launched container to find out when it goes to 'Running' state - 'Container Running' 

4. Use inspect to get IP address and host for the container and measure time to TCP connectivity.
